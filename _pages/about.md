Just an average IT nerd that loves what he does.  I work fulltime as a Lead DevOps Engineer for a startup and love being able to help optimize our software delivery process.

I started out my IT career straight out of High School back in 2001 and self taught myself and passed some certifications and got my first job on a Helpdesk.

From there I worked my way up the corporate ladder always trying to learn more and soak up everything new I could, fast forward after being in Storage, Security, managing Help Desks and more, I'm now in DevOps for the past 5-10 years and love it.

I hope to be able to do videos to help others learn and understand how things work and maybe take a different approach or viewpoint to their own work as they are in their day to day lives.

I also love Jeeps and Offroading and Camping, here is a recent pic of me and the Jeep.
